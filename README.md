# micora
Micora is another responsive website I built with only CSS, HTML and JavaScript.
It's just a demo of how a professional Website of a company can look like. You are welcome to use this website for your own and to adjust it to your preferences.

## How to access

Unfortunately, this website has not been published yet. But I try to make it happen as fast as possible.

## Testing

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m1rels/micora
   ```

2. In VS Code go to index.html, right-click and choose "Open with Live Server". You should see the website popping up in your browser.
